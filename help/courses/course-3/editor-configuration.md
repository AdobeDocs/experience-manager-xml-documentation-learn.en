# XML Editor Configuration

If you work in a restrictive environment, you can choose which features your authors are able to see by customizing the Editor Configuration within a specific Folder Profile. Applying this Folder Profile can change the look and feel of the Editor itself, the CSS Templates, the Snippets available, and the Content Version Labels.

Sample files that you may opt to use for this lesson are provided in the file _xmleditorconfiguration.zip_.
