## Inserting an image into a topic

There are multiple ways to insert an image into your topic.

You can drag and drop an image from your local system into your topic. If your image is already uploaded, you can also drag and drop it directly into your topic from the left rail. Alternatively, you can use the Insert Image button to insert images that are currently not visible in the left rail, and to further configure your image before inserting it.

For the following, ensure that your topic is open in the document editor.

### Inserting an image with drag and drop

1. Select the image file from your local system or the left rail, and drag and drop it into your topic.

   Your image displays in the editor.

### Inserting an image with the Insert Image button

## Saving a new version of a topic

Versioning allows you to review and compare different versions. You can even roll back to a previous version.

As you have made a significant change to your topic, you may now find it useful to save your current work as a new version.

1. Select the **Save as New Version** icon.

   Labels allow you to specify the version you want to include when publishing.

   > 
   > If your program is configured with predefined labels, you can select from these to ensure consistent labelling. 
1. Select **Save**.

   You have created a new version of your topic, and the version number is updated.
