# Publish a PDF output

With the XML Documentation solution, you can generate PDFs of individual topics or an entire map file. You can publish your content in a PDF format using one of the three methods below: 

* **DITA-OT**  

Use this method to generate a PDF output for a map from the map dashboard. You can set publishing properties before generating the PDF by creating an output preset for the map that is open in the map dashboard. To create or edit an output preset, the *Understanding the output presets* section in the [XML Documentation for AEM as a Cloud Service User Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/xml-documentation-solution/cs-mar-22/XML-Documentation-for-Adobe-Experience-Manager_CS_User-Guide_EN.pdf). 

For more information on generating a PDF using the DITA-OT method, see [Generate PDF using DITA-OT](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/xml-documentation-for-adobe-experience-manager/index.html#t=DXML-master-map%2Fgenerate-output-pdf.html). 

* **FrameMaker Publishing Server (FMPS)**

Use this method to generate a PDF output from not only the DITA content, but also FrameMaker documents (.book and .fm) available in your AEM repository. The PDF can be created by configuring an output preset and published using FrameMaker Publishing Server (FMPS). You can design and configure the look-and-feel of your output for PDF and other formats and store the same in a setting file (.sts). This setting file is then used by FMPS to generate output for a DITA map or .book file. To create or edit an output preset, see the  *Understanding the output presets* section in the [XML Documentation for AEM as a Cloud Service User Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/xml-documentation-solution/cs-mar-22/XML-Documentation-for-Adobe-Experience-Manager_CS_User-Guide_EN.pdf).

For more information on configuring FMPS, see [Generate output from FrameMaker documents](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/xml-documentation-for-adobe-experience-manager/index.html#t=DXML-master-map%2Ffm-output-generatation.html). 

* **Native PDF publishing** 

Use this method to generate a feature-rich PDF output based on W3C CSS3 and CSS paged media standards. With Native PDF publishing, you can use templates to set the layout and styling for your content and apply various settings to fine-tune your PDF. In addition, you can modify and create your own templates with the template editor. 

 For more information on Native PDF publishing, see [Using Native PDF publishing](#native-pdf-publishing). 


## Using the Native PDF publishing {#native-pdf-publishing}

When authoring content, it becomes essential to ensure that the content is optimized for viewing, editing, and printing. Using standards such as the W3C CSS3 for content styling and CSS paged media standards for page definition properties such as size, margins, orientation, page breaks, headers, footers, and page numbering, you can set the view and layout for your PDF document ensuring consistency and usability. The Native PDF publishing feature uses these standards to generate a PDF. 

With the native PDF publishing, you can use predefined templates to ensure consistency in content layout and structure, apply stylesheets to alter the look-and-feel of your output, optimize PDF, set printer marks, allow screen reader support, set PDF conformance, embed fonts, and much more.  

Generating a PDF using Native PDF publishing has two aspects: 

* Use of templates to apply styling to content, set page layouts, and various settings to fine-tune your PDF. Authors can choose to use/modify the sample templates provided or create custom templates and set advanced configuration options used by publishers and developers. 

* Create or configure a PDF output preset to control the PDF settings. Once you create a PDF output preset, you can generate the PDF.  

For more information, see [Generate a PDF output](#generate-pdf-output).

## Create a PDF output preset {#create-output-preset}

The first step in generating a PDF output is to create a PDF output preset, which is a collection of publishing properties assigned to a map. You can create an output preset for any map which is open in the Map View panel or configure an existing preset to quickly generate a PDF for the same map. 

From the PDF output preset you can select a template, apply conditions, set restrictions to control how a user interacts with your PDF, configure advanced settings like compression, conformance, and more.  

To create or configure a PDF output preset: 

1. In the Output tab, click **Presets** in the left sidebar. 
The Preset panel opens. 
![preset panel](assets/preset-panel.png)
2. In the output **Presets** panel, do one of the following:  
   * Double-click a predefined PDF output preset to view it.
   * Click the + icon against **Presets** to add a new output preset of **Type: PDF**  
3. To configure settings of an existing PDF preset:   
   * Click the  **Options** ![options](assets/options.svg) icon next to the desired output Preset and select **Edit**. 
You can use the following settings in the **General**, **Layout**, **Security**, and **Advanced** tabs to configure a PDF output preset: 

**General**

Use to specify basic output settings, such as specify output path, PDF file name, and more. 

| Setting  | Description|
| --- | --- |
|**Output Path**|   The path within the AEM repository where the PDF output is stored. Ensure that the output path is not located inside the project folder. If left blank, the output gets generated in the default DITA map output location.|
|  **PDF file**  | Specify a file name to save the PDF. By default, the PDF file name adds the DITA map name along with the preset name. For example, ditamap is ‘TestMap’ and the name of the preset is ‘preset1’ then the default name of the pdf will be ‘TestMap_preset1.pdf’.  |
| **Apply Conditions using** |   For conditionalized content, choose from the below options to generate a PDF output based on those conditions: <br>* **None Applied** Select this option if you do not want to apply any condition on the map and source content. <br> * **Ditaval File** Select a DITAVAL file to generate conditionalized content. To select, click against Condition Preset and locate the file. <br> * **Condition Preset** Select a condition preset from the drop-down to apply a condition while publishing the output. This option is visible if you have added a condition for the DITA map file. The conditional settings are available in the Condition Presets tab of the DITA map console.
