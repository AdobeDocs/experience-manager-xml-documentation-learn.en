**Note**: Currently, this is being released as a beta feature. If you wish to know more about this feature, contact your customer success manager.

### Support for knowledge base site path in Article-based publishing

XML Documentation solution as Cloud Services provides the article-based publishing feature to incrementally generate an output of one or more topics or publish your content to a knowledgebase platform. With the February release, you have an additional option to choose the Knowledge Base site path to which the topic/map needs to be published. Once you select the path, the output is generated at the specified path.  

### Web Editor enhancements

Many enhancements and new features have been added in the Web Editor:

* **Improved dialog on file close**

XML Documentation solution prompts you to save your changes and unlock your locked files when you try to close a file opened in the Web Editor. The prompts are displayed based on the **Ask for check-in on close** and **Ask for new version on close** settings configured by your administrator.

Based on the configuration, you get the option to save the changes and create a new version of your document. Or, you can also check in the file and save the changes to the current version.

For more details, see *File close and save scenarios* in the User Guide.

* A non-breaking space has been added to the character pallet.  A **non-breaking** space prevents an automatic line break at a particular point in an HTML document. Web Editor supports a non-breaking space for both AEM Site and HTML5 output.

* When you upload an image from the Web Editor, a confirmation dialog is displayed if an image with the same name already exists. You can either keep both files - existing and the new file, or overwrite the existing file and save only the new file.  

* If any user has locked any file for edits, an administrator can release the lock and check in the file. This feature will be helpful when some files need to be edited but have been locked by users who are not available to check in the file

### Map dashboard

When you select to download the DITA map, the request is queued, and you receive a notification once the map is ready to download. You can choose to download the map file immediately or download it later from the link provided in the AEM notification Inbox.
