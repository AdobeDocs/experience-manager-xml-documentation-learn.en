## New features and enhancements

Many enhancements and new features have been added in the Web Editor:

### Improved key resolution

A DITA content key reference inserts a part of content from one topic into another. It uses a key to locate the content. The key references associated with a DITA topic need to be resolved. The selected root map takes the highest precedence to resolve key references.

Now the key references are resolved on the basis of the root map set in the following order of priority: 

1. User Preferences
2. Map View panel 
3. Folder Profile

For more details, see *Resolve key references* section in the User guide.

### Add a custom panel in the left panel

Now you can add a custom panel within the left panel of the Web Editor. You can use a custom panel for various purposes like providing help or doing the testing for a project. If a custom panel has been configured, then it also appears in the list of panels within the **Editor Settings**. You can toggle the switch to show or hide the custom panel.

### Ability to change the document state of topics in a DITA map

Now you can easily change the document state of selected topics within a DITA map. You can also open and edit the properties of selected topics in a DITA map from the **More Options** menu at the bottom of the Map View panel.
