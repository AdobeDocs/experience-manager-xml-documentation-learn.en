# XML Documentation Releases

XML Documentation for Adobe Experience Manager is an application deployed onto AEM. It is a powerful, enterprise-grade component content management solution (CCMS) which enables native DITA support in Adobe Experience Manager, empowering AEM to handle DITA-based content creation and delivery. 

XML Documentation packages are available in two modes - UUID build and non-UUID builds.

Customers will need to decide between UUID and non-UUID mode at the time of first setup (please connect with your Customer Success Manager to help you make the decision based on your usecase).

When upgrading from one version of XML Documentation to a newer version, customers will need to ensure they pick the same mode (UUID / non-UUID) to match their existing mode. A non-UUID build should not be directly upgrade to a UUID build. Moving from non-UUID build to UUID build would need content migration. 

The following list contains the latest XML Documentation packages available for installation, corresponding AEM versions (pre-requisites), download links of packages, and other helpful information. It is recommended to only use the latest build of XML Documentation. If for some reason, you need access to older builds, please connect with your account's Customer Success Manager.
