## New features and enhancements

### New Baseline dashboard

[!DNL XML Documentation] for AEMaaCS March release provides the Baseline feature integrated inside the Web Editor. You can now create baselines from the Web Editor and use them to publish or translate topics of different versions.

Note: For upgraded system, please update the latest **ui_config.json** for Folder Profile.

Use this feature to create a baseline with a specific version of the topics available on a specific date and time. Also, you get the API support to create or update a baseline with a label defined for a version of topics.

You can search the files based on filenames, or file location. You can also filter the topics to be displayed in the baseline editing window and sort them based on specific columns.

The performance for the baseline creation process has been further improved. The process to create baselines is asynchronous, so you can continue editing other files in the Web Editor while the baseline is being created. For more details, see *Create and manage baselines from the Web Editor* in the User Guide. 

Note: The Baseline tab on the map dashboard is hidden by default. Your administrator can enable the Baseline tab on the map dashboard.

### Improved Web Editor refresh behavior

The following  enhancements are now available with the browser refresh operation in the Web Editor:

* Now you get the support to refresh the browser while you edit your 
content in the Web Editor. If you hit the browser refresh icon while one or more files with
unsaved changes are opened for editing, you are prompted to save your files or cancel the refresh action. 

* Even on refreshing the browser, the views of the left panel and the right panel are retained.  

* The active topic or DITA map is reopened in the content editing area.

### Publishing enhancements

The publishing process has been further improved with the latest release of [!DNL XML Documentation] for AEMaaCS:

* Baselines have been honored for the metadata of AEM site output. You can also process the properties of a baseline version as metadata. If no baseline is defined, then the properties of the latest version are processed as metadata.

* The **File Name** and **DITA-OT Command Line Arguments** options have been added for HTML5, EPUB, and Custom output presets. Now you can specify the file name with which you want to save the output. You can also specify the additional arguments that you want DITA-OT to process while generating output.
